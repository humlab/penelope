CHINESE
OPERA
(Cont'd from
page 20)
and miraculously miss each other every
time, the adversaries pant like two
blood-thirsty leopards, first making you
gasp and in the next moment roar
with laughter.
The laughter is released not from
comic facial contortions but springs out
of impossible situations, fantastic pos¬
tures and the superb orchestration of
the actors who perform a breathtaking
and precise acrobatic ballet.
The choreography which makes one's
head spin in its complex patterns has
been evolved through hundreds of years
of tradition and training, has been
worked by ancient masters, perfected
and matured through the ages. The
performances do not seem to have
been rehearsed in theatre halls at
scheduled times but through centuries,
through generations.
I do not know any theatre which
requires less knowledge of the spoken
word than the Chinese opera. In
"The River" we vividly see the old
boatman tie his boat to the bank, walk
through the mud and help the young
girl to embark. The wobbling of the
boat and the swaying of the girl as the
boatman rows her across the deep
waters seem absolutely real.
Product of time's crucible
IN the butterfly dance the acrobatic
feats of the players form a pattern
of colours and singing lines of
human limbs. Women and men in
bright costumes jump and somersault
and look like butterflies skimming and
kissing each other in the air. In its
presentation this piece is nearer to the
Western concept of ballet.
The simplification of form in Chinese
opera does not arise out of a primitive
or naive folk quality but from a highly
evolved technique, the product of
centuries of strenuous search. This art
simmered and bubbled in the crucible
of time and in the process all super¬
fluity has been shed. Its simplicity has
the conscious master's hand behind it,
the craftsmanship of the super-painter
who with a few strokes of his brush
sketches a human figure, a scene of
battle or a running horse.
In the creation of new opera China
has borrowed much from the West.
"The White Haired Girl" and "The
Butterflies" and the more recent operas
are a blend of Western realism with
native traditions, using harmonic music
patterns and symphonic orchestration
as a background to solo music.
China has much to offer Western
opera which today seems to be at a
stalemate so far as form is concerned.
This exchange of cultures is a unique
phenomena of our times when coun¬
tries like the members of one family
come together with their different
languages, songs, costumes and dances.
They have much to give and take from
each other and thereby enrich world
culture which is a heritage of all
humanity. (Photos Pic, Paris.)

Letters to the editor
Sir,
I have been reading with interest
your issue No. 4/5 1954 concerning
Japan today. Your articles show
the high standard of progress that
country has made in such a very
short time and the Interesting
fusion of western materialism with
Oriental philosophy that exists
there. I think it would be a pity
if, in the attempt to raise the
standards of the "backward" peo¬
ples of the world, the Western
powers were to impose not only the
advantages of their standards upon
the less fortunate, but also the
disadvantages. It seems to me that
the article giving the view of
Japanese youth could be very well
taken to heart by the "'Ijin" (for¬
eigner). You list six points of
criticism of the Western way of life
by the Japanese youth and it
appears to me that they do in the
main strike well and truly home.
This would seem to be just cause
for us to stop and consider that
when we try and aid the Asians
and Africans to reach a higher
standard of living, we should do so
through their eyes, not just through
our own. We should remember
that what is ultimately desirable
for us may be quite . despicable to
them. We should only help them
as far as we can when it is compat¬
ible with their ideals, not with our
own. We can easily measure ma¬
terial wealth but it is very difficult
for us to say that, just because we
are materially stronger than they
are, then we are also spiritually
stronger.
One example of the apparent
superiority of the outlook of those
we are supposed to be helping is
the strength of the family ties in
Japan. I venture to suggest that if
such ties were still in existence in
the Western World then such
undesirable features of our civili¬
zation as the high divorce rates,
juvenile delinquency, and the
abandoned condition of many of
the aged would not exist to the
extent that they do today. Your
apology in the following issue
(No. 6, 1954, "The American Negro")
for the racial and other discrimina¬
tion that exists in the United
States, materially the richest of
nations in the world today, may be
quoted as an example of what we
should avoid.
I would also like to point out that
in your issue prior to the one
devoted to Japanese youth (No. 3,
1954, "Freedom of Information")
you publish figures that show
Japanese-language daily newspaper
circulation as being second only to
English-language circulation. Sure¬
ly this would indicate that there
would be a ready market for a
Japanese language edition of the
Courier, particularly since you state
in the following issue that the
Japanese in general are anxious to
learn about other peoples. Or is it
that your activities are restricted
to member countries? If so there
would appear to be little hope for a
universal understanding of each
other's problems and ambitions if
only one half of the world is
allowed to see and hear those
problems and ambitions. Incident¬
ally, I notice also that German-
language dailies have a greater
circulation than either French or
Spanish.
In the matter of explaining
ourselves to each other, I feel that
it is only by so doing that we can
prevent our leaders from leading
us into another dreadful slaughter
that is so wasteful of human life
and effort. Indeed, may I make
this a plea to Unesco to try to
break down the barriers to such an
understanding that exist between
the political "East" and the political
"West", and present to each the
true picture of what we are and
what we seek. Surely both sides
are subjected to such a barrage of
propaganda and half-truths that it
is only a very distorted and
emotional picture that exists at
present.
Certainly it can be said that if
we cannot live together in peace
we shall die together in futile
strife and the slow and gradual
progress of centuries will be lost
for the average man. We have so
obviously reached the stage when
there is no advantage for either
side in pursuing their selfish ends
by force when both victors and
vanquished are losers and the
common man becomes a slave
either to the politics of one side
or the economics of the other.
Each of the major wars of this
century has brought increasing
restrictions upon the freedom and
liberty of the private individual_in
order to protect "States". Surely
it is time that men grew up and
realized that States consist of the
individuals that reside therein
and although school-boys squabble,
grown men learn to tolerate each
other.
